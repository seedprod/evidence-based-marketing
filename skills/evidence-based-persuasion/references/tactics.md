## Loss Aversion

📚 *Kahneman & Tversky, 1979*

### Weak vs Strong

| Weak (Gain Frame) | Strong (Loss Frame) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Save $100" | "Stop losing $100" |
| "Get more customers" | "Stop losing customers to competitors" |
| "Grow your list" | "Your list isn't growing itself" |
| "Improve your workflow" | "How much time are you wasting?" |

### Placement
- Headlines
- CTA buttons
- Abandoned cart emails
- Renewal reminders

### Anti-Pattern
Manipulative fear ("You'll fail without this") damages trust. Focus on realistic losses.

---

## Social Proof

📚 *Cialdini, 1984; Asch, 1951*

### Hierarchy of Effectiveness

| Type | Strength | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Specific results | Strongest | "Increased conversions 37%" |
| Named testimonials | Strong | "Sarah M., Marketing Director" |
| Aggregate numbers | Medium | "Join 10,000+ customers" |
| Logos | Medium | Client logo bar |
| Generic praise | Weakest | "Great product!" |

### Placement
- Near CTAs
- Below the fold (after value prop)
- Checkout pages

### Anti-Pattern
Fake testimonials destroy trust if discovered. Generic stock photos hurt credibility.

---

## Reciprocity

📚 *Cialdini, 1984; Strohmetz et al., 2002*

### Application

Give value before asking:
- Free guides, templates, tools
- Helpful content without gating
- Free tier with real utility
- Surprise bonuses after purchase

### Placement
- Top of funnel (lead magnets)
- Post-purchase (unexpected bonus)
- Customer support (over-deliver)

### Anti-Pattern
Expecting immediate return ("Download this free guide to get pitched immediately") negates the effect.

---

## Commitment & Consistency

📚 *Freedman & Fraser, 1966*

### Application (Foot-in-the-Door)

Start small, escalate:
1. Newsletter signup
2. Free trial
3. Paid plan
4. Annual plan
5. Expansion/upsell

### Micro-Commitments
- Quiz completions
- Email replies
- Social follows
- Saved preferences

### Placement
- Lead capture forms
- Onboarding flows
- Upgrade paths

---

## Scarcity

📚 *Cialdini, 1984*

### Legitimate Uses

| Type | Example | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Real inventory | "3 left in stock" | Physical products |
| Real deadline | "Sale ends Friday" | Time-limited offers |
| Cohort-based | "Next cohort starts Jan 15" | Courses, programs |
| Capacity limits | "Only 50 clients at a time" | Services |

### Anti-Patterns (Avoid)
- Fake countdown timers
- "Only 3 left!" when unlimited
- Evergreen "limited time" offers
- Sophisticated buyers recognize and distrust

---

## Authority

📚 *Cialdini, 1984*

### Application

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Credentials | "PhD in Behavioral Science" |
| Experience | "15 years in the industry" |
| Endorsements | "Recommended by [Expert]" |
| Media logos | "Featured in Forbes, TechCrunch" |
| Certifications | Security badges, industry certifications |

### Placement
- About page
- Author bios
- Near CTAs
- Footer (trust badges)

---

## Narrative Transportation

📚 *Green & Brock, 2000*

### Application

Stories reduce counter-arguing:
- Customer case studies with narrative arc
- Founder origin stories
- "Imagine..." scenarios
- Before/after transformations

### Story Structure
1. Character (relatable customer)
2. Problem (their struggle)
3. Journey (discovering solution)
4. Transformation (results)

### Placement
- Case studies
- Sales pages (long-form)
- Email sequences
- About page

---

## Processing Fluency

📚 *Reber & Schwarz, 1999*

### Make Copy Easier to Process

| Harder | Easier |
|--------|--------|
| Long sentences | Short sentences |
| Jargon | Simple words |
| Walls of text | White space |
| Low contrast | High contrast |
| Fancy fonts | Clean fonts |

### Application
- Headlines: 6-12 words
- Sentences: 15-20 words max
- Paragraphs: 2-3 sentences
- Bullet points for lists

### Why It Matters
Easier to read = feels more true. Confusion = distrust.

## Serial Position Effect

📚 *Murdock, 1962*

### Application

| Position | Remember? | Put Here |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| First | ✅ Yes (primacy) | Key benefit, main message |
| Middle | ❌ No | Supporting details |
| Last | ✅ Yes (recency) | CTA, key message repeat |

### Page Structure
1. **Headline** — Main promise (primacy)
2. **Body** — Supporting points
3. **CTA** — Repeat promise, call to action (recency)

---

## Anchoring

📚 *Tversky & Kahneman, 1974*

### Application

First number sets the reference point:
- Show original price before discount
- Lead with enterprise/highest tier
- Reference competitor pricing
- Show "value" in larger terms ("$2,000 value")

### Examples
- ~~$599~~ $299
- "vs $500/year alternatives"
- "Enterprise plans start at $999/month" (then show $199 plan)

## By Funnel Stage

| Stage | Principles | Tactics |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Awareness** | Curiosity, Social Proof | Headlines that intrigue, user counts |
| **Interest** | Authority, Processing Fluency | Credentials, clear simple copy |
| **Consideration** | Narrative Transportation, Specificity | Case studies, specific results |
| **Decision** | Scarcity, Loss Aversion | Deadlines, "don't miss" framing |
| **Retention** | Commitment, Reciprocity | Loyalty programs, surprise value |
