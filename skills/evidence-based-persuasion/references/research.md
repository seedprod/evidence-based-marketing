## Foundational Works

### 📚 Cialdini's Influence Research (1984, 2016)

**Citation:** Cialdini, R. B. (1984). *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion*. Harper Business.

**Updated:** Cialdini, R. B. (2016). *Pre-Suasion: A Revolutionary Way to Influence and Persuade*. Simon & Schuster. [Added 7th principle: Unity]

**Seven Principles:**

1. **Reciprocity** — We feel obligated to return favors
   - Study: Waiters giving mints saw tip increases of 3% (one mint), 14% (two mints), 23% (personalized)
   - Citation: Strohmetz, D. B., Rind, B., Fisher, R., & Lynn, M. (2002). Sweetening the till: The use of candy to increase restaurant tipping. *Journal of Applied Social Psychology*, 32(2), 300-309.

2. **Commitment/Consistency** — We align actions with prior commitments
   - Study: Small request (window sign) → 4.5x more likely to agree to large request (yard sign): 76% vs 17%
   - Citation: Freedman, J. L., & Fraser, S. C. (1966). Compliance without pressure: The foot-in-the-door technique. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 4(2), 195-202.

3. **Social Proof** — We follow what others do
   - Study: Hotel towel reuse increased from 35.1% to 44.1% with descriptive norm messaging
   - Citation: Goldstein, N. J., Cialdini, R. B., & Griskevicius, V. (2008). A room with a viewpoint: Using social norms to motivate environmental conservation in hotels. *Journal of Consumer Research*, 35(3), 472-482.

4. **Authority** — We trust experts and credentials

5. **Liking** — We buy from people we like
   - Factors: Similarity, compliments, familiarity, association

6. **Scarcity** — Limited items are valued more

7. **Unity** (2016) — We favor those in our in-group

### 📚 Dual Process Theory (Kahneman, 2011)

**Citation:** Kahneman, D. (2011). *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. Farrar, Straus and Giroux.

**Key Finding:**
- **System 1:** Fast, automatic, emotional, intuitive
- **System 2:** Slow, deliberate, logical, effortful

**Implication:** System 1 makes the decision → System 2 justifies it. Lead with emotion, support with logic.

### 📚 Prospect Theory / Loss Aversion (1979)

**Citation:** Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A. (1979). Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk. *Econometrica*, 47(2), 263-291. https://doi.org/10.2307/1914185

**Nobel Prize:** Daniel Kahneman, 2002 (Tversky died 1996).

**Key Finding:** Losses loom larger than gains (~2x).

**Evidence:**
- People reject 50/50 bets to win $150 or lose $100
- Loss of $100 feels equivalent to gain of ~$200

**Replication:** 2020 global study across 19 countries confirmed 90% replication.
- Citation: Ruggeri, K., et al. (2020). Replicating patterns of prospect theory for decision under risk. *Nature Human Behaviour*, 4, 622-633.

**Application:**

| Gain Frame | Loss Frame (More Effective) |
|------------|----------------------------|
| "Save $100" | "Stop losing $100" |
| "Get more customers" | "Stop losing customers" |

## Cognitive Effects

### 📚 Processing Fluency (1999)

**Citation:** Reber, R., & Schwarz, N. (1999). Effects of perceptual fluency on judgments of truth. *Consciousness and Cognition*, 8(3), 338-342. https://doi.org/10.1006/ccog.1999.0386

**Key Finding:** Information that's easier to process is perceived as more true.

**Experiment:** Statements in high-contrast colors judged true more often than low-contrast.

**Factors That Increase Fluency:**
- Readable fonts
- High contrast
- Simple language
- Rhyming

**Application:** Simple copy > complex copy for believability.

---

### 📚 Serial Position Effect (1962)

**Citation:** Murdock, B. B. (1962). The serial position effect of free recall. *Journal of Experimental Psychology*, 64(5), 482-488. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0045106

**Key Finding:**
- **Primacy Effect** — First items remembered best
- **Recency Effect** — Last items remembered best
- Middle items forgotten

**Application:**
- Key message in headline (first)
- Repeat key message in CTA (last)
- Don't bury important info in middle

---

### 📚 Zeigarnik Effect (1927)

**Citation:** Zeigarnik, B. (1927). Über das Behalten von erledigten und unerledigten Handlungen. *Psychologische Forschung*, 9, 1-85.

**Key Finding:** Incomplete tasks remembered better than completed ones.

**⚠️ Replication Note:** Modern meta-analyses show small effect size (dz = 0.15). Effect may depend on task involvement and individual differences.

**Application (use with caution):**
- Open loops in copy
- Progress indicators ("You're 80% done")
- Cliffhangers in email sequences

### 📚 Narrative Transportation (2000)

**Citation:** Green, M. C., & Brock, T. C. (2000). The role of transportation in the persuasiveness of public narratives. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 79(5), 701-721. https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.701

**Key Finding:** When absorbed in a story, people counter-argue less.

**Evidence:**
- Experiment 1 (N=97): Transportation increased story-consistent beliefs
- Experiment 2 (N=69): Transported readers found fewer "false notes"

**Application:**
- Customer stories > feature lists
- "Imagine..." scenarios
- Brand origin stories

### 📚 Elaboration Likelihood Model (1986)

**Citation:** Petty, R. E., & Cacioppo, J. T. (1986). The elaboration likelihood model of persuasion. *Advances in Experimental Social Psychology*, 19, 123-205.

**Two Routes:**

| Central Route | Peripheral Route |
|---------------|------------------|
| High involvement | Low involvement |
| Processes arguments | Uses heuristics |
| Lasting change | Temporary change |
| Needs strong arguments | Needs cues (authority, liking) |

**Application:**
- High-stakes → detailed arguments (central)
- Low-stakes → social proof, authority cues (peripheral)

## Social Proof Research

### 📚 Conformity Studies (1951)

**Citation:** Asch, S. E. (1951). Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgments. In H. Guetzkow (Ed.), *Groups, leadership and men* (pp. 177-190). Carnegie Press.

**Key Finding:** 75% of participants conformed to obviously wrong answers **at least once** across 12 trials.

**Clarification:** Per-trial conformity rate was ~32%. The 75% = participants who conformed on at least one trial.

**Control:** Error rate <1% without group pressure.

### 📚 Descriptive vs Injunctive Norms (1990)

**Citation:** Cialdini, R. B., Reno, R. R., & Kallgren, C. A. (1990). A focus theory of normative conduct. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 58(6), 1015-1026.

**Types:**
- **Descriptive** — What people DO ("10,000 customers use this")
- **Injunctive** — What people SHOULD do ("Smart marketers use this")

Both work; descriptive generally stronger for behavior change.

## Additional Effects

### 📚 Mere Exposure Effect (1968)

**Citation:** Zajonc, R. B. (1968). Attitudinal effects of mere exposure. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 9(2, Pt.2), 1-27.

**Key Finding:** Repeated exposure increases liking, even without recognition.

**Application:** Consistent brand presence builds preference. Repetition creates comfort.

---

### 📚 Anchoring Effect (1974)

**Citation:** Tversky, A., & Kahneman, D. (1974). Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases. *Science*, 185(4157), 1124-1131.

**Key Finding:** First number heavily influences subsequent judgments, even when arbitrary.

**Application:** Show higher price first to anchor expectations.

---

### 💼 Specificity Effect

**Status:** Practitioner-validated (no single seminal study)

**Key Finding:** Specific numbers more believable than round numbers.

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Saves time" | "Saves 2.5 hours/week" |
| "Many customers" | "10,847 customers" |

**Why:** Specific implies measurement; round implies approximation.
