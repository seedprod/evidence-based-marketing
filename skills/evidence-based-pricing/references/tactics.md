## Price Perception

### Anchoring

📚 *Tversky & Kahneman, 1974*

First number seen sets the mental reference point.

**How to use:**
- Show "was" price: ~~$599~~ $349
- Lead with higher-priced option
- Reference competitor pricing: "vs $588/year"
- Show total cost comparison: "Most spend $400+ over 3 years"

**Example:**
```
"Enterprise plans start at $999/month"
[Then show $349 lifetime — feels like a bargain]
```

---

### Charm Pricing (Left-Digit Effect)

📚 *Thomas & Morwitz, 2005; ~24% avg sales lift*

$199 feels significantly cheaper than $200.

**How to use:**
- End prices in 9: $199, $349, $499
- Works best for value positioning
- Use round numbers for premium/luxury

**When to use round numbers:**
- Premium products ($500 signals quality)
- Luxury brands
- Donations

---

### Price-Quality Heuristic

Higher price = assumed higher quality.

**How to use:**
- Don't undervalue premium offerings
- Higher-priced options legitimize lower ones
- "Expensive" tier makes mid-tier feel reasonable

---

### Specific vs Round Numbers

💼 *Practitioner-validated*

Specific prices ($347) feel more calculated than round ($350).

**When to use specific:**
- Considered purchases
- B2B / higher-ticket
- When you want to imply careful cost calculation

**When to use round:**
- Luxury/premium
- Donations
- When simplicity matters

---

## Choice Architecture

### Decoy Effect

📚 *Ariely, 2008 — 52% shift in Economist study*

Adding an inferior option makes target look better.

**Classic pattern:**
| Option | Price | Value |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A | $59 | Basic |
| B (Decoy) | $125 | Print only |
| C (Target) | $125 | Print + Digital |

Nobody wants B, but it makes C obvious.

**How to use:**
- Create plan that's clearly worse value than target
- Same/similar price, fewer benefits
- Test carefully — can backfire if too obvious

---

### Center Stage Effect

📚 *Valenzuela & Raghubir, 2009*

Middle option chosen disproportionately.

**How to use:**
- Place target plan in center
- Works with 3+ options
- Combine with "Most Popular" badge

---

### Compromise Effect

People avoid extremes, choose middle.

**How to use:**
- If target is mid-tier, add cheap AND expensive options
- Extremes make middle feel "safe"
- Good/Better/Best structure

---

### Choice Overload

📚 *Iyengar & Lepper, 2000 — 10x conversion difference*

Too many options = decision paralysis.

**How to use:**
- Limit to 2-3 pricing tiers
- 4+ options hurt conversion
- If complex, add clear recommendation

---

## Framing Effects

### Loss Aversion

📚 *Kahneman & Tversky, 1979 — losses hurt ~2x more*

**In copy:**
- "Don't miss out" > "You'll gain"
- "Stop losing customers" > "Get more customers"
- "Protect your investment" > "Grow"

**In pricing:**
- Free trials leverage endowment (hard to give up)
- "Grandfathered pricing" — fear of losing rate

---

### Partitioned Pricing

Breaking price into parts changes perception.

**Lower perceived cost:**
- "$29/month" < "$349/year"
- "$0.99/day" feels trivial

**Higher perceived value:**
- Itemized: "Base + Features + Support"
- Shows what they're getting

---

### Reference Pricing

Explicit comparison to another price.

**Types:**
- Competitor: "Gleam costs $588/year"
- Previous: "Was $599"
- Calculation: "Save $400 over 3 years"

---

### Bundle Pricing

Combined pricing obscures individual values.

**How to use:**
- "All features included"
- Single price for multiple benefits
- Makes comparison harder (advantage: seller)

---

## Social Dynamics

### Social Proof

💼 *ProfitWell: 20-30% lift from "Most Popular" badge*

**How to use:**
- "Most Popular" badge on target plan
- "X customers chose this"
- Customer logos on pricing page
- Review counts

---

### Scarcity

Limited availability increases value.

**Legitimate uses:**
- Real inventory limits
- Actual deadlines
- Cohort-based programs
- Capacity limits

**Avoid:**
- Fake countdown timers
- "Only 3 left!" when unlimited
- Sophisticated buyers distrust

---

## Transaction Psychology

### Free Effect (Zero Price Effect)

$0 has disproportionate psychological impact.

**How to use:**
- Free trial > $1 trial
- "Free shipping" > equivalent discount
- Free tier for lead generation

---

### Endowment Effect

📚 *Kahneman et al., 1990 — 2x+ valuation gap*

People value what they own more.

**How to use:**
- Free trials create ownership feeling
- "Your plan" language after signup
- Personalization increases attachment

---

### Payment Timing

When payment occurs affects perception.

| Timing | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Prepay | Product feels "free" during use |
| Pay-as-you-go | Each use reminds of cost |
| Subscription | Ongoing commitment |

---

### Pain of Paying

Cash > Card > Digital for perceived pain.

**How to use:**
- Digital payment reduces friction
- Auto-renewal reduces repeated decisions
- Annual = one pain point vs 12 monthly

---

## Rule of 100

💼 *Berger — determines discount format*

| Price | Better Format |
|-------|---------------|
| Under $100 | Percentage ("20% off") |
| Over $100 | Absolute ("$100 off") |

**Why:** 20% of $50 ($10) sounds small. $100 off $500 sounds big. Same math, different perception.

---

## Quick Reference

| Challenge | Tactics |
|-----------|---------|
| Low conversions | Reduce options, add social proof, simplify |
| Wrong plan selection | Decoy, center stage, "Most Popular" badge |
| Price objections | Anchoring, reference pricing, reframe value |
| High refund rate | Remove impulse triggers, add friction |
| Discount expectation | Remove popups, hold prices, add value instead |

## Testing Checklist

Before launching pricing changes:

- [ ] One variable at a time?
- [ ] Control group established?
- [ ] Metrics defined (conversion, distribution, refunds)?
- [ ] Sample size sufficient?
- [ ] Timeline set (2+ weeks minimum)?
- [ ] Segmentation planned (new vs returning)?
