# Evidence-Based Persuasion

Research-backed principles of persuasion — the WHY behind effective copy.

## Evidence Marking

Most marketing advice mixes proven research with folklore. This skill separates them:

- 📚 = Peer-reviewed academic research (cite with confidence)
- 💼 = Practitioner-validated (widely used, not academically tested)

## Top 5 Principles

| # | Principle | Finding | Source |
|---|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | **Loss Aversion** | Losses hurt ~2x more than equivalent gains | 📚 Kahneman & Tversky, 1979 |
| 2 | **Processing Fluency** | Easier to read = more believable | 📚 Reber & Schwarz, 1999 |
| 3 | **Social Proof** | 75% conform to group behavior at least once | 📚 Asch, 1951 |
| 4 | **Narrative Transportation** | Stories reduce counter-arguing | 📚 Green & Brock, 2000 |
| 5 | **Commitment & Consistency** | Small yes → big yes (4.5x increase) | 📚 Freedman & Fraser, 1966 |

## The Persuasion Sequence

```
Emotion (System 1) → Decision → Logic (System 2) → Justification
```

People decide emotionally, then rationalize. Lead with emotion, support with logic.

*📚 Kahneman, "Thinking, Fast and Slow" (2011)*

## Cialdini's 7 Principles of Influence

| Principle | Mechanism | Copy Application |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Reciprocity** | Give first, receive later | Free value before asking |
| **Commitment** | Small yes leads to big yes | Micro-conversions first |
| **Social Proof** | Follow the crowd | Testimonials, user counts |
| **Authority** | Trust experts | Credentials, endorsements |
| **Liking** | Buy from people we like | Relatable voice |
| **Scarcity** | Limited = valuable | Genuine deadlines only |
| **Unity** | "One of us" | Shared identity |

*📚 Cialdini, "Influence" (1984), Unity added in "Pre-Suasion" (2016)*

## Loss Aversion

Losses hurt ~2x more than equivalent gains feel good.

| Framing | Effectiveness |
|---------|---------------|
| "Save $100" | Good |
| "Don't lose $100" | Better |
| "Stop wasting $100/month" | Best |

*📚 Kahneman & Tversky, Prospect Theory, Econometrica (1979) — Nobel Prize 2002*

## Processing Fluency

Easier to process = more believable.

- Short sentences
- Simple words
- High contrast
- White space

*📚 Reber & Schwarz, Consciousness and Cognition (1999)*

## Quick Application Guide

| Principle | Use When | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Social Proof | Building trust | "Join 10,000+ customers" |
| Scarcity | Creating urgency | "Only 5 spots left" (if true) |
| Authority | Establishing credibility | "Recommended by [Expert]" |
| Loss Aversion | Motivating action | "Don't miss out" |
| Reciprocity | Lead generation | Free guide before email ask |
| 💼 Specificity | Increasing believability | "37% faster" not "much faster" |

## By Funnel Stage

| Stage | Primary Principles |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Awareness** | Curiosity, Social Proof |
| **Consideration** | Authority, Specificity |
| **Decision** | Scarcity, Loss Aversion |
| **Retention** | Commitment, Reciprocity |

## Anti-Patterns

| Tactic | Why It Fails |
|--------|--------------|
| Fake scarcity | Destroys trust |
| Vague claims | No credibility |
| Logic-first | Emotion decides first |
| Too many CTAs | Choice overload |
