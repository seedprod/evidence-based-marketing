# Pricing Experiments

Key research that shaped pricing psychology.

**Legend:**
- 📚 = Peer-reviewed academic research
- 💼 = Practitioner/business case study

## 📚 Anchoring Effect (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)

Foundational behavioral economics research.

**Citation:** Tversky, A., & Kahneman, D. (1974). Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases. *Science*, 185(4157), 1124-1131.

### Setup
Participants estimated percentage of African countries in UN. First spun a wheel showing either 10 or 65 (random anchor).

### Results
| Anchor | Median Estimate |
|--------|-----------------|
| 10 | 25% |
| 65 | 45% |

Arbitrary anchor influenced estimates even though participants knew it was random.

### Pricing Application
First price seen sets reference point. Show higher price first (original, competitor, enterprise tier) to anchor expectations.

## 📚 The Economist Experiment (Ariely, 2008)

Demonstrates the decoy effect (asymmetric dominance).

**Citation:** Ariely, D. (2008). *Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions*. HarperCollins. Chapter 1.

**Study context:** 100 MIT students.

### Setup
Economist subscription options:

| Option | Price |
|--------|-------|
| Digital only | $59 |
| Print only | $125 |
| Print + Digital | $125 |

### Results (3 options)
| Option | Selection |
|--------|-----------|
| Digital only | 16% |
| Print only | **0%** |
| Print + Digital | **84%** |

### Results (2 options — decoy removed)
| Option | Selection |
|--------|-----------|
| Digital only | **68%** |
| Print + Digital | 32% |

### Revenue Impact
- With decoy: $11,444
- Without decoy: $8,012

### Lesson
The "useless" print-only option shifted 52% of buyers to premium. Nobody chose it, but its presence made print+digital obvious.

## 📚 The Jam Study (Iyengar & Lepper, 2000)

Demonstrates choice overload / paradox of choice.

**Citation:** Iyengar, S. S., & Lepper, M. R. (2000). When choice is demotivating: Can one desire too much of a good thing? *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 79(6), 995-1006.

**Study context:** Draeger's Grocery Store, Menlo Park, California.

### Setup
Jam tasting booth:
- Condition A: 24 varieties
- Condition B: 6 varieties

### Results
| Condition | Stopped | Purchased |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| 24 jams | 60% | **3%** |
| 6 jams | 40% | **30%** |

### Lesson
More options attracted attention but paralyzed decisions. **10x higher conversion with fewer options.**

### Application
Limit pricing tiers to 2-3 options.

## 📚 Charm Pricing Research (Thomas & Morwitz, 2005)

Demonstrates the left-digit effect.

**Citations:**
- Thomas, M., & Morwitz, V. (2005). Penny wise and pound foolish: The left-digit effect in price cognition. *Journal of Consumer Research*, 32(1), 54-64.
- Poundstone, W. (2010). *Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value*. Hill and Wang.

**Study context:** MIT & University of Chicago mail-order catalog.

### Setup
Women's clothing, identical items:
- Condition A: $34
- Condition B: $39
- Condition C: $44

### Results
$39 (charm price) outsold both $34 AND $44.

### Meta-Analysis
Poundstone's analysis of 8 studies: charm prices increased sales **~24% on average**.

### Why It Works
Left-digit effect: $3.99 encoded as "3-something" not "almost 4."

### Application
- $X99 for value positioning
- Round numbers ($200) for premium/luxury

## 📚 Center Stage Effect (Valenzuela & Raghubir, 2009)

Demonstrates position-based preference.

**Citations:**
- Valenzuela, A., & Raghubir, P. (2009). Position-based beliefs: The center-stage effect. *Journal of Consumer Psychology*, 19(2), 185-196.
- Atalay, A. S., Bodur, H. O., & Rasolofoarison, D. (2012). Shining in the center: Central gaze cascade effect on product choice. *Journal of Consumer Research*, 39(4), 848-866.

### Key Findings
- Middle options receive more visual attention (eye-tracking)
- Consumers assume retailers place popular items in center
- Belief serves as social proof

### When Effect is Stronger
- Options similar in nature
- Consumers lack strong preferences
- Purchasing for others

### Application
Place target plan in center position. Combine with "Most Popular" badge.

## 📚 Endowment Effect (Kahneman, Knetsch & Thaler, 1990)

Demonstrates ownership increases perceived value.

**Citation:** Kahneman, D., Knetsch, J. L., & Thaler, R. H. (1990). Experimental tests of the endowment effect and the Coase theorem. *Journal of Political Economy*, 98(6), 1325-1348.

### Setup
Half of participants given coffee mugs, half given nothing. Asked to trade.

### Results
| Group | Valuation |
|-------|-----------|
| Sellers (own mug) | ~$7 |
| Buyers (don't own) | ~$3 |

WTA/WTP ratio exceeds 2x.

### Application
- Free trials create psychological ownership
- Users reluctant to give up after using
- "Your plan" language reinforces ownership

---

## 📚 Loss Aversion (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)

Losses feel ~2x more painful than equivalent gains.

**Citation:** Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A. (1979). Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk. *Econometrica*, 47(2), 263-291.

### Pricing Application
- Free trials leverage loss aversion (hard to give up)
- "Grandfathered pricing" — fear of losing current rate
- "Don't miss out" > "You could gain"

## 💼 Williams-Sonoma Bread Maker

Classic anchoring/compromise effect example.

**Source:** Anecdote attributed to Itamar Simonson (Stanford). Underlying research: Simonson, I., & Tversky, A. (1992). Choice in context: Tradeoff contrast and extremeness aversion. *Journal of Marketing Research*, 29(3), 281-295.

**Note:** Frequently cited business anecdote, not a published controlled study.

### Setup
- Original: $275 bread maker (poor sales)
- Added: $429 "deluxe" model

### Results
Sales of $275 model nearly doubled.

### Lesson
Expensive option anchored perception and triggered compromise effect.

## 💼 SaaS Pricing Data (ProfitWell)

Modern SaaS practitioner findings.

**Source:** ProfitWell/Price Intelligently aggregated customer data. Not peer-reviewed.

### Key Findings

**Optimal tiers:**
- 3-4 tiers optimal
- 5+ decreases conversion
- Single tier limits revenue

**"Most Popular" badge:**
- 20-30% increase in selection
- Works B2B and B2C

**Annual vs Monthly:**
- Showing annual increases selection 15-20%
- "Save X%" messaging effective

---

## 💼 Rule of 100 (Berger)

Determines discount format.

**Source:** Berger, J. (2013). *Contagious: Why Things Catch On*. Simon & Schuster.

### Rule
- **Under $100** → percentage feels bigger
- **Over $100** → absolute feels bigger

### Examples
| Price | Better Framing |
|-------|----------------|
| $50 | "20% off" ($10) |
| $500 | "$100 off" (20%) |

---

## 📚 Free Shipping vs Discount

Free shipping preferred over equivalent discount.

**Citation:** Chen, Y., Yang, S., & Zhao, K. (2021). Coupons or free shipping? Effects of price promotion strategies on online review ratings. *Information Systems Research*, 32(1), 117-135.

### Key Finding
- 64% prefer free shipping over equivalent discount (Epsilon, 2023)
- Free shipping has consistently positive effect on review ratings
- Coupons can decrease long-term ratings through perceived lower quality

### Application
"Free shipping" often outperforms equivalent price reduction.
